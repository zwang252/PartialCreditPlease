# PartialCreditPlease

<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, We're Partial Credit Please</h1>
<h3 align="center">A team of 3 Binghamton University CS 375 Students: Zane Wang, Stanley Lin, and Michael Cohen</h3>

- 🔭 This project focuses on the [Knight's Tour problem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/363427.363463)

- 💬 We found this project interesting, as it was our first exposure to **Heuristic Algorithms (Warnsdorff)**

- 1️⃣ The first algorithm attempted utilizes the [Backtracking Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8126004)

- 2️⃣ The second algorithm attempted utilizes the [Warnsdorff Approach](http://www.cmat.edu.uy/~mordecki/articles/warnsdorff.pdf)

- 📝 Do Note: **Warnsdorff's Algorithm performs much better in practice but is not as reliable**
