# PartialCreditPlease

<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, We're Partial Credit Please</h1>
<h3 align="center">A team of 3 Binghamton University CS 375 Students: Zane Wang, Stanley Lin, and Michael Cohen</h3>

- 🔭 This project focuses on the [Knight's Tour problem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/363427.363463)

- 💬 We found this project interesting, as it was our first exposure to **Heuristic Algorithms (Warnsdorff)**

- 1️⃣ The first algorithm attempted utilizes the [Backtracking Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8126004)

- 2️⃣ The second algorithm attempted utilizes the [Warnsdorff Approach](http://www.cmat.edu.uy/~mordecki/articles/warnsdorff.pdf)

- 📝 Do Note: **Warnsdorff's Algorithm performs much better in practice but is not as reliable**

<h3 align="left">Program Usage Instructions</h3>

- Perform <b>git clone</b>
- Open a terminal window and navigate to the cloned directory
- Enter <b>make</b> into your terminal to run the Makefile
- Type <b>./pcpkt 'starting square' 'algorithm choice'</b>, where starting square can be square on a standard 8x8 chessboard and algorithm choice is either Backtracking (1) or Warnsdorff (2)
	- Example: To find a knight's tour from location A2 using Warnsdorff's
		- <b> ./pcpkt A2 2
- Your output will be printed to the terminal
